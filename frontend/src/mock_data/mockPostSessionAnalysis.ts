    overall_comment:
      "You've done an excellent job in conveying complex computer science concepts clearly and accurately, maintaining a good balance between depth and accessibility. Your ability to explain with examples and analogies has significantly enhanced understanding, showcasing your strong grasp of the topics discussed.",
    strengths:
      "Your explanations stand out for their accuracy and clarity, particularly in breaking down intricate processes like merge sort and depth-first search into understandable segments. You've effectively used examples to illustrate these processes, making the concepts accessible to an undergraduate audience. Additionally, your discussions are comprehensive, covering key aspects and comparisons with related algorithms, which shows a deep understanding of the subjects.",
    room_for_improvement:
      "There's an opportunity to refine your explanations for greater conciseness and to expand your use of exemplification. While your examples are effective, incorporating a wider range of scenarios and simplifying technical language without losing detail could make your explanations even more engaging and understandable.",
    suggestions_for_improvement:
      "To further enhance your explanations, consider the following: 1. Work on condensing your discussions where possible, avoiding repetition and focusing on the essence of the concept. 2. Integrate more varied and detailed examples, especially for complex steps or concepts, to simplify understanding. 3. Continue to adapt your language and examples to match the audience's level, simplifying technical jargon without compromising the depth of your explanation. These adjustments will help make your already strong explanations even more impactful and accessible.",
